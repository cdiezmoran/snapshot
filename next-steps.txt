Strategy:

1. When a User signs up, they will be creating their User account as well as a Person object in the Persons/People collection.  

2. Users will need the ability to add a person with an associated organization (autocomplete or create new) and contact (create new), and each contact will have an associated location (autocomplete or create new).  

3. Users will need the ability to add an Organization with associated People, Contacts and Locations.

4. Users will need to add Interactions of type from enum with People and/or Organizations, and may add a location.  

Options:

1. How do we get off Mongoose and Mongo and try Postgres or Arango?  

DevOps:

1. Do we need the createServer and tearDownServer functions like in Thinkful?  

2. Tests need to be created for all controllers, particularly Person, Organization, Contact, Location, and Interaction.  



SNAPSHOT.SAVE
Users will try to input DataPoints into a Snapshot, and the actual numbers and
data needs to be saved somehow.
For example, a user will want to save a Snapshot for an Organization, and wants
to include 6 DataPoints.  For all six DataPoints, there will be a quantity, such
as $1,000,000 in Trailing Twelve Month's Revenue
